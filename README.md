# Design and Create a Language Translator App that can translate a word from any one of the provided languages to another. 

## This project is created using React Native and npm.

- This minimalistic app contains a field for the user to input the text he/she wants to translate from and a translate button which acts as the interface between two languages.

- After submitting the translate button, the text will be converted to the desired language.

- Upon pressing the button, the app makes an api call to fetch the translation of the word to the desired language.

- Google translation service is used in this translation application. Google APIs are used to make API calls and fetch data.

- There is a translated field where the translated data is displayed to the user.
